## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I was trying to figure out create a command line to gather datasets from Kaggle and also looked for appropriate logistic regression projects to be our classification examples on GitHub.


## This Week's Plan

> I am having interviews and exams this week, so I won't work on much on this project this week.


## Anything Blocking?

> I still don't know how to get datasets from Kaggle yet.


## Notes
